Perfect ✅ — here’s an enhanced version of the **README.md** with clear **theoretical explanations** and **ASCII diagrams** for both **B+ Trees** and **Extendible Hashing**.
It’s written in a style suitable for GitHub (clean Markdown, visually structured, and beginner-friendly).

# 🌳 B+ Tree and Extendible Hashing Implementations in C++

This repository contains **complete C++ implementations** of two classic data structures widely used in **database indexing** and **storage systems**:

* **B+ Tree** – for ordered, range-based indexing
* **Extendible Hashing** – for fast, dynamic hash-based lookup

Both implementations include **interactive terminal interfaces** that let you **insert**, **delete**, **search**, and **visualize** how the structures evolve step-by-step.

---

## 📘 1. B+ Tree Implementation

A **B+ Tree** is a multi-level balanced tree used in databases and filesystems for efficient **search, insertion, and range queries**.
It maintains sorted data and minimizes disk I/O by grouping keys into nodes.

### 🧠 Concept Overview

* Each **internal node** stores keys and child pointers.
* **Leaf nodes** store actual records (keys/values) and are linked for sequential access.
* When a node overflows, it **splits**, and keys are **promoted** up.
* When underflow occurs, nodes **merge or redistribute** keys.

### 📊 Structure Example

```
               [ 20 40 ]
              /    |    \
         [10]   [30]   [50 60]
```

Each `[ ... ]` represents a node.
Leaf nodes (bottom) contain actual keys or data pointers.

---

### ✨ Features

* **Dynamic Order**: Configurable branching factor (`m`) and leaf capacity (`m_leaf`).
* **Insertion/Deletion**: Fully supports node split, merge, and key redistribution.
* **Search**: Efficient O(log n) lookup.
* **Visualization**: Level-order printing of tree structure.
* **Parent Pointers**: Enables quick upward traversal and restructuring.

### 🗂 Directory Structure

```
├── B_Plus_Trees.cpp      # Implementation and CLI
```

### ⚙️ Compilation

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -o bptree B_Plus_Trees.cpp
```

### ▶️ Usage

```bash
./bptree
```

#### Commands

```
i <value>   Insert a key
d <value>   Delete a key
s <value>   Search a key
p           Print the tree structure
h           Show help
q           Quit
```

#### Example Session

```
Enter m , m_leaf: 4 3
> i 10
> i 20
> i 30
> p
[ 10 20 30 ]
```

## 🧮 2. Extendible Hashing Implementation

**Extendible Hashing** is a **dynamic hash table** that automatically expands or shrinks based on the number of inserted keys.
It’s particularly efficient for disk-based hash indexing where collisions need controlled management.

---

### 🧠 Concept Overview

* Each **directory entry** points to a **bucket**.
* Each bucket has a **local depth** – how many bits of the hash it uses.
* The directory has a **global depth** – how many bits are used overall.
* When a bucket overflows:

  * If its local depth < global depth → **split bucket**.
  * If local depth = global depth → **double the directory** (expand).

---

### 📊 Visualization Example

#### Initial (Global Depth = 1)

```
Directory:
0 → Bucket A
1 → Bucket B

Each bucket stores up to 2 elements.
```

#### After Expansion (Global Depth = 2)

```
Directory:
00 → Bucket A
01 → Bucket B
10 → Bucket A   <-- Points to same bucket as 00
11 → Bucket C   <-- New bucket after split
```

👉 Notice: Buckets with **local depth < global depth** are pointed to by **multiple directory entries**.

---

### ✨ Features

* **Automatic Directory Expansion** on overflow.
* **Bucket Splitting and Merging** with local depth tracking.
* **Directory Shrinking** when possible.
* **Set-Based Storage** for unique keys.
* **Interactive Menu Interface** for easy testing.

### 🗂 Directory Structure

```
├── extendible_hashing.cpp        # Implementation and CLI
```

### ⚙️ Compilation

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -o extendible extendible_hashing.cpp
```

### ▶️ Usage

```bash
./extendible
```

#### Menu Options

```
1 → Insert element
2 → Delete element
3 → Print directory
4 → Exit
```

#### Example Session

```
Enter your choice :
1 for Insertion
2 for Deletion
3 to print Directory Structure
4 to Exit
: 1
Enter element to insert : 12

: 3
********************
00        4 12
01        8
10        4 12
11        8
********************
```

Each directory entry shows:

* Binary directory index (`00`, `01`, etc.)
* Keys inside the corresponding bucket.
